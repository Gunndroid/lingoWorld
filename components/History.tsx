          The story so far...
          <br />
          <br /> <strong>In March 2011</strong> a foreigner lost in Buenos Aires
          observed the difficulty of befriending locals (despite their
          enthusiastically friendly nature towards foreigners). A problem was
          identified; A social convention was needed to unite locals and
          internationals. The first LingoWorld was organised on July 7th with
          the aim of offering Argentines an opportunity to practice languages
          and foreigners a chance to befriend the local Argentines.
          <br />
          <br />
          That same year,{" "}
          <strong>LingoWorld grew to some 300 monthly visits.</strong> A flag
          sticker format was devised to allow participants to self-organise
          without direct help from organisers. This would become the unique
          identifying feature of LingoWorld.
          <br />
          <br />
          By 2014 the format proved popular, receiving 2500+ monthly visits. We
          decided to export the &apos;buena onda&apos; to new cities starting in
          Cologne, London, Montreal.{" "}
          <strong>
            Over the next 5 years LingoWorld would open in yet more cities
            reaching 18K+ monthly visits across North + South America, Europe
            and Asia,
          </strong>{" "}
          as well as an online community of 100k&apos;s with dozens of
          volunteer-moderated community forums.
          <br />
          <br />
          In January 2020 we suspended events in Nanjing, other cities would
          quickly follow in just a few short weeks. We decided to use this
          down-time to take LingoWorld into a bigger mission of enabling
          communities to self-organise in cities around the world.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>In 2022 LingoWorld launched a new proposal</strong> to
          organise communities, establish consensus and promote solidarity, with
          an initial soft launch in Buenos Airesâ€¦

          A Journey Through Connections...
          <br />
          <br /> <strong>In 2011</strong>, in the bustling heart of MetroCity, a
          traveler realized the challenge of connecting with natives, despite
          their welcoming demeanor. The inaugural &apos;LingoWorld&apos; was
          held in July, aiming to offer natives an avenue for cultural exchanges
          and newcomers a chance to connect deeply with the city.
          <br />
          <br />
          The same year saw{" "}
          <strong>
            LingoWorld gaining traction with 300+ attendees monthly
          </strong>
          . A badge system was introduced, enabling attendees to network
          effortlessly, becoming the hallmark of LingoWorld.
          <br />
          <br />
          Come 2014, the concept had garnered a following of 2500 monthly
          enthusiasts. LingoWorld expanded its horizons to cities like NeoTown,
          EastVille, and TerraPort.{" "}
          <strong>
            Over half a decade, our presence spread across continents,
            witnessing 18K monthly visitors,
          </strong>{" "}
          and an online community in the hundreds of thousands, supported by
          numerous dedicated volunteers.
          <br />
          <br />
          2020 saw a pause in our gatherings, with the first halt in SunCity,
          followed by others. This period was utilized to envision a broader
          scope for LingoWorld, focusing on empowering global communities to
          come together.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>By 2022, LingoWorld unveiled an initiative</strong> centered
          on community building, consensus, and unity, piloted in MetroCity...
